# Customer Segmentation Project Using K-Means Clustering - 

# Problem Statement -

There is a famous mall in the city, and they want to find customer behavior based on their purchase and other attributes so that they can provide personalized services to their customers, do targeted marketing, or improve customer satisfaction.
To achieve this, we need to build a system that can automatically group customers. For example:
The first group could be regular buyers who frequently purchase items.
The second group could be rare buyers who make occasional purchases.
By creating these customer groups, the mall can gain better insights into customer behavior and make more informed business decisions.

Insights -

* Blue cluster have very less income and their spending is also less which is understandable because they have less Income so they cannot afford to spend more in the mall.
* Violet cluster have more income but still they are not spending more in the mall, So we need to give them offer or have to do marketing then their is chance of incresing in sales.
* Green cluster have moderate income and spending so no need to spend on them.
* Yellow cluster have low income but they are spending more in the mall, regularlly buyers so we can do more focus on them and recommend more products to this people.
* Red cluster have more income and spending so obviously they can buy in the mall but we can not ignore this people, we need to recommend more so that sales can increase.
